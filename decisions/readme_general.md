# GitHub General READMEs

_This document covers considerations for a template README that the author can use when creating new repositories._

The author has employed his repository template (`AFg6K7h4fhy2-Template`; see [here](https://github.com/AFg6K7h4fhy2/AFg6K7h4fhy2-Template)) for replications (e.g. [Re-TDWMFC-2024](https://github.com/AFg6K7h4fhy2/Re-TDWMFC-2024)), templates (e.g. [Quarto-Website-Template](https://github.com/AFg6K7h4fhy2/Quarto-Website-Template)), personal endeavors (e.g. [Personal-Helpers](https://github.com/AFg6K7h4fhy2/Personal-Helpers)), and software packages (e.g., [Paleo-Utils](https://github.com/AFg6K7h4fhy2/Paleo-Utils)), among other things.

Each repository has a top-level `README` document that provides onlookers context and direction to navigate the repository successfully.

At present, the author has left filling in the `README` of each repository generated from his template to his future self.

The content of the template `README` has, for a long time, been the following:

> # BLANK README
>
> This repository was generated from [AFg6K7h4fhy2](https://github.com/AFg6K7h4fhy2)'s [template repository](https://github.com/AFg6K7h4fhy2/AFg6K7h4fhy2-Template).

> If you are seeing this message, then this repository likely contains no meaningful content.

Since there are conceivably sections within top-level `README`s that are repeated across different repository types (e.g. software packages, replications, etc...), the author believes that it make his life easier to have the union of `README` sections across these repository types in the template `README`, rather than the present approach, which consists of leaving the `README` barren.

If there are sections which do not apply to a given repository, then the author can simply remove them in Prepare Repository For Production issue.

These sections and their descriptions in the template top-level `README` should probably be accompanied by an opening clause declaring that the contents below belong to a template `README`, lest the author
