Other considerations:

* How much information to have publicly available?
  * ...on GitHub?
  * ...on a personal website?
  * ...on forums and other sites?
  * Is having where the author works too much information? Given that the author is not able to make this information (the organization) disappear from his profile, the author feels inclined to "lay low".
* What goals are there with having a personal README?
  * Permit others to understand my values.
  * Permit others to understand and make informed predictions about my behavior.
  * Permit others to make an informed decision about whether they want to communicate with me.
  * Permit others to make an informed judgement about my person.
* How much information is too burdensome to readers?
  * Dropdown menus can greatly help with permitting more information.
  * Some elements in the Sections list might better be situated on a personal website.
  * Perhaps a threshold of 5 sections total or per dropdown is a reasonable bottleneck.
* Leaving the README blank is an option.
* Leaving the biography blank is an option.
